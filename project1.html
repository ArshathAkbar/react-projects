        <p style="font-size: larger;"> <b> Napoleon Bonaparte </b> born on <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">15 August 1769</span> , later known by his regnal name <b>Napoleon I</b>, was a French military commander and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the leader of the French Republic as First Consul from <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">1799 to 1804</span>, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1804 </span> until<span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1814 </span> and again in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">1815</span>. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many liberal reforms that have persisted, and is considered one of the greatest ever military commanders. His campaigns are still studied at military academies worldwide. Between three and six million civilians and soldiers died in the Napoleonic Wars.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">He Supported the French Revolution in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">1789</span> while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1796</span>, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring decisive victories and became a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1799 </span>  and became First Consul of the Republic.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> In <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1804</span>, to consolidate and expand his power, he crowned himself Emperor of the French.
Differences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">August 1805</span>. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1806</span>, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> June 1807 </span></span> at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but <b>Napoleon</b> solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.
Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> August 1808</span>. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War aided by a British army, culminating in defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1812</span>.</p>
<p style="font-size: larger;">The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Armée. In <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> 1813 </span>, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France, resulting in a large coalition army defeating <b>Napolean</b> at the Battle of Leipzig. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> April 1814</span>. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power.
Napoleon escaped in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> February 1815  </span>and took control of France. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);"> August June 1815 </span>. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">1821</span> at the age of <span style="background-color: rgb(194, 67, 194);">51</span>.
Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the lands he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland, and parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.
